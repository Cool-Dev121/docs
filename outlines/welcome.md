1. Welcome to the Meteor guide
  1. This is a set of articles outlining opinions on best-practice application development in the Meteor framework

  3. Hard APIs can be found at [docs] and community packages at [atmosphere].
2. What is Meteor?
  1. A curated set of JS client + server code for building web and mobile applications
