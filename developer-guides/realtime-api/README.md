# Realtime API

__IMPORTANT!__ These docs are based on an unreleased version of the API. If you want to try it out, point your client to __wss://open.rocket.chat/websocket__.

Our realtime API is composed of two elements: [Method Calls][1] and [Subscriptions][2]. Both of them are supported directly in the websocket connection.

To make it possible to have everything working on the same connection we use RPC with the following format.

```json
{
    "msg": "type-of-communication",
    "id": "unique-id",
    ... // per call defined data
}
```

The type of communication is defined according to the call:
 - [Method Calls][1]: `method`
 - [Subscriptions][2]: `sub`

 Please note, the server will send you "ping" and you must respond with "pong" otherwise the server will close the connection.

Before requesting any method / subscription you have to send a connect message:
```json
{
	"msg": "connect",
	"version": "1",
	"support": ["1"]
}
```

[1]:1.%20Method%20Calls/
[2]:2.%20Subscriptions/

You can find a basic example script that uses the 'ddp' NodeJS package to subscribe to the Realtime-API stream of a Group/Channel here [https://github.com/jszaszvari/rocketchat-ddp-listener](https://github.com/jszaszvari/rocketchat-ddp-listener)
