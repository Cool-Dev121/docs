# Rocket.Chat Deployment

There are multiple deployment options for Rocket.Chat.

## Rocket.Chat Hosting

You can request for a beta of Rocket.Chat hosting service! You can have a server up and running, professionally managed, without installations, configuration, maintenance and management head-aches. Just send an email to support@rocket.chat and request for _"Hosting beta"_.

While in Beta, the hosting is free. Once we leave the beta stage, you'll have the option to export your data if you do not want to continue service and want to host it yourself.
