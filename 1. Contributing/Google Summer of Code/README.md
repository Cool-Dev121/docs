## Ideas

* **Description:** taking and embedding a calendar inside rocket.chat, being standalone yet integrating with all the calendars out there so people can schedule meetings and be reminded of upcoming meetings that are inside rocket.chat
* **Desirable Skills:** <Please populate>
* **Goal/Deliverable:** The ability to schedule a meeting in Rocket.Chat

### Use of Chromecast as Presentation Room
* **Mentors:** @bradley.hilton
* **Description:** Use Chromecast as presentation output which shows a chat room and will join any Jitsi / WebRTC meetings that are started in it, this way meetings can be started inside Rocket.Chat and the Chromecast can be on a TV/Monitor inside a conference room.
* **Desirable Skills:** Some Javascript coding skills will be required to complete this task. Students with WebRTC knowledge and/or who have already produced Chromecast apps are on a good start. A Chromecast is required for this task.
* **Goal/Deliverable:** Being able to pair a room with Chromecast, displaying it's messages. Chromecast app needs to be able to automatically join a Jitsi/WebRTC video call.
