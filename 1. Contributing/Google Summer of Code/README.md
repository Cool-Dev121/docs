# Google Summer of Code 2017

## Ideas

### Meeting Scheduling
* **Mentors:** <Put Name here>
* **Description:** taking and embedding a calendar inside rocket.chat, being standalone yet integrating with all the calendars out there so people can schedule meetings and be reminded of upcoming meetings that are inside rocket.chat
* **Desirable Skills:** <Please populate>
* **Goal/Deliverable:** The ability to schedule a meeting in Rocket.Chat

### Use of Chromecast as Presentation Room
* **Mentors:** @graywolf336 
* **Description:** Use Chromecast as presentation output which shows a chat room and will join any Jitsi / WebRTC meetings that are started in it, this way meetings can be started inside Rocket.Chat and the Chromecast can be on a TV/Monitor inside a conference room.
* **Desirable Skills:** Some Javascript coding skills will be required to complete this task. Students with WebRTC knowledge and/or who have already produced Chromecast apps are on a good start. A Chromecast is required for this task.
* **Goal/Deliverable:** Being able to pair a room with Chromecast, displaying it's messages. Chromecast app needs to be able to automatically join a Jitsi/WebRTC video call. 

### Create an SDK for Mobile Apps to include a chat inside other apps.
* **Mentors:** @rafaelks, @laggedHero
* **Description:** Create an SDK (for both iOS and Android) to embed in any app that wants to have a chat inside it. It could be useful for support and also for chat in enterprise apps. One example is an app thatâ€™s used by all sellers from a company to be able to communicate with each other using Rocket.Chat. Another example is something very similar to Intercom (https://www.intercom.com/mobile)
* **Desirable Skills:** Students will be required to code in either Java for Android SDK or Swift for the iOS SDK. Students will also need to understand how Rocket.Chat communicates over websockets.
* **Goal/Deliverable:** To have an SDK that allows App Developers to embed a chat system inside their own apps using Rocket.Chat servers to deliver messages.
