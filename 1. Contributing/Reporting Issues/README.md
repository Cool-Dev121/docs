# Reporting Issues

You don't have to write code to contribute! We are always looking for help with creating or updating documentation, testing our apps (web, desktop and mobile) and reporting bugs.

We appreciate any & all bug reports! Did you find a bug? Reporting is easy!

Simply open an [Issue](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues) in the applicable repository.

Here are some suggested things to include, when applicable, which may help us troubleshoot a problem:

* Operating System / Version / Architecture (64 bit?)
* Browser type & Version (if web app), any browser add-ons which may be involved (e.g. AdBlocker, NoScript, etc.)
* Desktop Environment (if desktop app) / Version
* Rocket.Chat edition / Version or [build number](/2. Getting%20Support)
* Expected behavior vs. Actual behavior (In other words, the "bug")
* Can it be reproduced? If yes, how?
* Relevant snippets from your error logs
* Screen shots if helpful to communicate the problem

## Gathering Logs

Collecting and including logs often helps us get to the root of the issue quicker.

### Browser logs
To collect logs from your browser press <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> and switch to the console tab.  Errors should appear in red

### Server logs
To collect logs from your browser as an Admin log into your Rocket.Chat.  From there click the arrow by your avatar and goto Administration.  Once there you will see: `View Logs`

Often its useful to open this in another browser and reproduce the problem again and you will see an exception pop up in the logs.
