# Reporting Issues

You don't have to write code to contribute! We are always looking for help with creating or updating documentation, testing our apps (web, desktop and mobile) and reporting bugs.

We appreciate any & all bug reports! Did you find a bug? Reporting is easy!

Simply open an [Issue](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues) in the applicable repository.

Here are some suggested things to include, when applicable, which may help us troubleshoot a problem:

* Operating System / Version / Architecture (64 bit?)
* Browser type & Version (if web app), any browser add-ons which may be involved (e.g. AdBlocker, NoScript, etc.)
* Desktop Environment (if desktop app) / Version
* Rocket.Chat edition / Version or [build number](/2. Getting%20Support)
* Expected behavior vs. Actual behavior (In other words, the "bug")
* Can it be reproduced? If yes, how?
* Relevant snippets from your error logs
* Screen shots if helpful to communicate the problem
