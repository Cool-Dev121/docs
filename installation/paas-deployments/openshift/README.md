## 1. Login

First of all we need to login to OpenShift API URL to create our project. The command to login to
OpenShift Online Next Gen is shown below:

```bash
# oc login https://api.preview.openshift.com --token=<api_token>
```

You can find the API Token to login to OpenShift Online Next Gen in the about page of the Web console.

## 2. Create a project

After login to OpenShift Online Next Gen, we need to create a project to host our Rocket.Chat application:

```bash
$ oc new-project rocket-chat
```

## 3. Import the ImageStream and templates

Clone the Rocket.Chat GitHub repository and import the templates to your OpenShift project:

```bash
# git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat
# cd Rocket.Chat
# oc create -f .openshift/rocket-chat-ephemeral.json
# oc create -f .openshift/rocket-chat-persistent.json
```

## 4. Create the app

Create the application using the newly created templated and passing the `MONGODB_DATABASE`,`MONGODB_USER`
 and `MONGODB_PASSWORD` parameters:

```bash
# oc new-app rocket-chat -p MONGODB_DATABASE=rocketchat -p MONGODB_USER=rocketchat-admin -p MONGODB_PASSWORD=rocketchat
```

- Rocket.Chat uses a domain check code to verify the validity of the e-mail address. To disable it, run the following commands:

```bash
# oc port-forward <mongodb_pod> 27017
# mongo localhost:27017

> use rocketchat
> db.auth('rocketchat-admin','rocketchat')
> db.rocketchat_settings.update({_id:'Accounts_UseDNSDomainCheck'},{$set:{value:false}})
```
