# Contributing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to Rocket.Chat Docs.
If this is the first Open Source project you will contribute to,
we strongly suggest reading GitHub's excellent guide
["Contributing to Open Source"](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

## Getting Started

You can find a list of issues [here](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Docs/issues).
When you find something you would like to work on just comment on it and we will add an __In Progress__ label.

## Creating a new PR

When making small changes like typos and such, you can edit the file directly on GitHub, but if you are making bigger changes or adding new files to the docs, is recommended to follow these steps:

- Fork the appropriate repository to your account.
- This is usually [here](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Docs).
- Clone your fork.
- Before starting read our [Markdown Style Guide](Markdown%20StyleGuide.md)
- Make your changes locally.
- (Optional but recommended for bigger changes) Use our [Docs Generator](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Docs.Generator) to test the changes.
- Commit your changes to a new branch.
- Push that branch to your repository.
- Open a PR.
- Make sure you include a description of why you're making the changes.
