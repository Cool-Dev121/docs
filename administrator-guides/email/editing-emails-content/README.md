# Editing Email Content

Almost all the pre defined emails that are sent to users in your Rocket.Chat server can be customized.

To customize an email content simply select the email you want to change, and set the `Custom` option to `true`.

From there you can change the subject and the body of the email. When writing the body of the email you can add _placeholders_ that will be changed for real data when the email is sent. E.g. `[Site_Name]` will be changed to your Rocket.Chat server name.

You will have access to more _placeholders_ depending on which email you are editing. For a detailed list of available _placeholders_ check the text under the body field.
