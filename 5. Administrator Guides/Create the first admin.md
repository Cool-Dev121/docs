# Creating the first administrator

After you deploy your server, the first user to register becomes the administrator, with power to set other users as administrators.

In case your server has no administrators, you can create the first admin account by defining the environment variables ADMIN_PASS and ADMIN_EMAIL once.

```
export ROOT_URL=http://your-host-name.com-as-accessed-from-internet:3000/
export MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/rocketchat
export PORT=3000
export ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export ADMIN_PASS=supersecret
export ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com

node main.js
```
