<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
	<CORSRule>
		<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
		<AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
		<AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
		<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
		<AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
		<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
		<AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
	</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```
