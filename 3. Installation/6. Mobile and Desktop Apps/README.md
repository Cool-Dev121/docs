### Android and iOS Mobile users

Enter the URL to your Rocket.Chat server (e.g. https://open.rocket.chat) to initialize the app.   This needs to be done the first time you run the app after installation.

Use two-fingers swipe up gesture to add more servers if you need to access multiple servers from one client.  

### Android and iOS Mobile Users running Rocket.Chat server on a Sandstorm Grain

1. On your phone in a browser open Sandstorm and open the Rocket.Chat grain.
2. Open the hamburger menu (upper-left) and choose "Get Webkey". (On the desktop view, you would click the key icon in the topbar.)
3. Optionally enter a label (e.g. "phone") and then click "create".
4. You'll be presented with a URL, aka a "webkey". Long-press on this URL, then choose "copy link address".
5. Open the rocket.chat app.
6. Paste in the copied URL (the whole thing!) as your Rocket.Chat server address.
7. That's it! No password is needed, since an authorization token is encoded into the URL.

## Native Firefox OS App

### Users

*Note: This works also works on Firefox for Android and the desktop browser.*

Point the browser on the Firefox OS device to your Rocket.Chat URL (e.g. https://open.rocket.chat), then add ```/fxos``` (e.g. https://open.rocket.chat/fxos) and press OK/enter. You will be prompted to install the app.

### Developers
 1. Make sure you have ```adb``` (android debug bridge) installed on your PC
 2. Enable developer mode on the mobile device
 3. Start your Firefox browser on the PC and connect your device
 4. Enter the Firefox WebIDE (Shift + F8 or go to Extras -> Web Developer -> WebIDE)
 5. "Project" -> "Open hosted app"
 6. Enter the path to the Rocket.Chat manifest.webapp **on your server**, e.g. https://open.rocket.chat/manifest.webapp - then press OK
 7. You should now see the icon and description inside WebIDE. Press the play button on top to install it on your device

### Admins
Do you want to use a custom URL to your Rocket.Chat, or maybe a custom icon and description?
Just edit the **manifest.webapp** file in the **/public** folder of the meteor project.
For more info, have a look at the [Firefox OS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest).
