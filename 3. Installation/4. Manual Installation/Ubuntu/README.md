# Deploying Rocket.Chat on Ubuntu

This guide explains how to deploy your own Rocket.Chat instance to a Ubuntu Linux machine using the command line.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- curl
- graphicsmagick

### System Configuration

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10
echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.0.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org curl graphicsmagick
```

We have to also install `npm`, which is the Node.js package manager. You can do this by typing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install npm
```

If you encountered some errors when trying to install `npm` try to install `nodejs` in the first place.

>The `nodejs` package contains the `nodejs` binary as well as `npm`, so you don't need to install npm separately.

```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

In order for some npm packages to work (such as those that require building from source) you will need to install the build-essentials package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

Install a tool to let us change the node version.

```bash
sudo npm install -g n
```

Meteor needs at least this version of node to work.

```bash
sudo n 0.10.43
```

### Setup MongoDB Replica Set

Rocket.Chat uses the [MongoDB replica set](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/replication/) **OPTIONALLY** to improve performance via Meteor Oplog tailing.  To configure the replica set:

#### For older MongoDB versions (2.4 and bellow)

Append `replSet=001-rs` into `mongod.conf` file:

```bash
$ echo replSet=001-rs >> /etc/mongod.conf
```

And restart Mongo:

```bash
service mongod restart
```

#### For new MongoDB versions (2.6 and above)

Using YAML syntax add this section into `mongod.conf`:

```bash
replication:
      replSetName:  "001-rs"
```

Restart Mongo:

```bash
service mongod restart
```

Start the MongoDB shell and initiate the replica set:

```bash
mongo
> rs.initiate()
```

The result should look like this

```
{
  "info2" : "no configuration explicitly specified -- making one",
  "me" : "localhost:27017",
  "info" : "Config now saved locally.  Should come online in about a minute.",
  "ok" : 1
}
```

After a few seconds, you should see your prompt turn into `001-rs:PRIMARY> `, this indicates the replica set is being used. Type `exit` to get back to your regular shell.

After you configured replica set, you **MUST** add the following environment variable before restarting Rocket.Chat server for it to take effect:

```
MONGO_OPLOG_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/local
```

## Install

Download Stable version of Rocket.Chat (or pick a version from [our releases page](https://rocket.chat/releases)):

```bash
curl -L https://rocket.chat/releases/latest/download -o rocket.chat.tgz
```

Then untar the binary release:

```bash
tar zxvf rocket.chat.tgz
```

This will expand everything into a `bundle` directory.

Next, make sure MongoDB server is already up and running.  Then, set environment variables and run the Rocket.Chat server:

```bash
mv bundle Rocket.Chat
cd Rocket.Chat/programs/server
npm install
cd ../..

export ROOT_URL=http://your-host-name.com-as-accessed-from-internet:3000/
export MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/rocketchat
export PORT=3000

node main.js
```

You **MUST** set the `ROOT_URL` environment variable to the Internet accessible URL to your server.

This will start the Rocket.Chat server running.

If you would like to start Rocket.Chat on an alternative port, use the environment variable PORT.

> If using port 80 you will have to run as root.  This is because it is a privileged port.

If you choose to do this.  You need to do something like this:

```bash
sudo ROOT_URL=http://your-host-name.com-as-accessed-from-internet/ \
    MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/rocketchat \
    PORT=80 \
    node main.js
```

Or...

```bash
sudo su
export ROOT_URL=http://your-host-name.com-as-accessed-from-internet/
export MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/rocketchat
export PORT=80

node main.js
```

> If you need to keep the server up and running across reboots, use a task manager such as forever, PM2 or write your own shell management scripts.

## Configure

Rocket.Chat is installed and needs to be configured. Follow these guides to properly configure everything your instance needs:

1. [Run Rocket.Chat behind a SSL Reverse Proxy](/3.%20Installation%2F4.%20Manual%20Installation%2FConfiguring%20SSL%20Reverse%20Proxy%20with%20Nginx.md)

## Update

In summary do the following:

1. Make sure server is down
1. Change into the directory where you have the `Rocket.Chat` directory
1. Remove the old server executables
  * `rm -rf Rocket.Chat`
1. Repeat Installation [step](#Install)

You can always [update directly](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/2408) to the newest version, the database migrations will execute from the old version to the new version.
