# Setting up Process Managers and Init Systems

## PM2


## Systemd

Deploy [Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat) to Linux that run on systemd (RedHat, Centos, Ubuntu, CoreOS and so on).

### Prerequisite

You need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/linux/started/) and [docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

### How to run Rocket.Chat on systemd.

```
git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/DockerFiles.git
cd systemd
cp ./*@* /etc/systemd/system && systemctl daemon-reload
mkdir -p /data/domains/
cd ..
cp GenericLinux /data/domains/example.org
vi /data/domains/example.org/docker-compose.yml # modify `ROOT_URL` and `MAIL_URL`
systemctl enable universal@example.org
systemctl start universal@example.org
```

### Backup

All data will be hourly backuped to `/data/domains/example.org/data` folder. We advise to copy this folder to a remote location in case of hardware failure.

## Upstart - Ubuntu
The following examples are upstart jobs which control automatic start-up and, if necessary, respawning of your Rocket.Chat app, as well as management of an optional hubot chat-bot.  
  
In order to use the examples, simply copy each example and save into a file, paying attention to the fact that the filenames should be preserved unless you edit the examples
to reflect any filename changes you make. Be sure to edit the environment variables, and possibly paths, according to your particular installation. Once you've saved the files to the
proper directory (/etc/init) usage is as simple as rebooting.
  
Which upstart management jobs that you use depend on what type of Rocket.Chat deployment you are using (Docker-compose, non-docker, etc). A race-condition exists with 
docker-compose which requires that mongo and the Rocket.Chat application be started independently, thus a slightly modified upstart job is required compared to non-docker instances. 
  
-------------------------  
  
### Non-Docker-Compose
Save as: `/etc/init/rocketchat.conf`  
```

# Wait for mongod before starting rocketchat app  
start on (started mongod)  
stop on runlevel [!2345]

# Export necessary variables and start the Applications / Services

    export ROOT_URL=https://host.yourdomain.tld 
    export PORT=3000

end script
```
  
Save as: `/etc/init/rocketchat_hubot.conf`  
```

    cd /home/administrator/myhubot
    
    # Launch Hubot
    exec bin/hubot -a rocketchat
end script
```

### Docker-Compose  
Save as: `/etc/init/rocketchat_mongo.conf`  
```
