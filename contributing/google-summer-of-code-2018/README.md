# Google Summer of Code 2018

## How to apply

Interested students should email the mentor(s) directly for discussion and further information.  You can also find them, most of the time, on our community server https://open.rocket.chat/  for real-time chat.   Many of the mentors are fluent in both Portuguese and English.  

If you have ideas and proposals that are not on our idea list, or if a mentor is not available, please email to gsoc+2018@rocket.chat.

For some real-time help on next steps, please visit our community server Google Summer of Code 2018 discussion channel:

Our application to become a 2018 GSoC organization is currently under review.  We will have more specific student application and deadline information here once (if) we are approved.
