# Voice and Video Calls

Using WebRTC for video and voice calls

## What you need

A modern machine with camera and mic.  Expensive old Windows machines are not so good, and tricky to configure.  Cheap new Chromebooks (less than US$200) work perfectly.  Macs work out of the box.

The latest version of Chrome or Firefox.  Safari and Edge may work soon in the future - but FaceTime (owned by Apple) and Skype (owned by Microsoft) may be business reasons why things are delayed.

Newer Android mobile phones and tablets (some less than US$50) will also work.

### Test your device for compatibility

Use this [online device compatibility verification tool](https://test.webrtc.org/) to determine if your machine and browser combination is ready for video conference.  Everything should pass except for IPv6 support.

###  Multi-users video / voice calls

This is a completely experimental implementation that stretches what web-rtc offers.  Use at your own risk.
