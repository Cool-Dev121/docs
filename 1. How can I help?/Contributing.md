# Contributing
First of all, thanks! It's really awesome that you're interested in contributing to Rocket Chat. If this is the first Open Source project you will contribute to, it'd be cool if you read GitHub's excellent guide ["Contributing to Open Source"](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).  

## Getting Started 
You can find Rocket.Chat repositories [here] (https://github.com/RocketChat). If you see some issue you are willing to work on, just comment on it. We will add an [In Progress label](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/stat%3A%20in%20progress), and that's it! Want a simple task to get you started? [We maintain a list of those](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/contrib%3A%20easy)!

**You don't have to write code to contribute!**  
We are always looking for help with creating or updating documentation, testing our apps (web, desktop and mobile) and reporting bugs. 

**Submitting Pull Requests**  
For contributions to code or documentation, you can fork the material, apply your contribution, and submit a [Pull Request] (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

**Submitting Bug Reports**  
We appreciate any & all bug reports! Did you find a bug? Reporting is easy! Simply open an [Issue] (https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues) in the applicable repository.  
  
Here are some suggested things to include, when applicable, which may help us troubleshoot a problem:

* Operating System / Version / Architecture (64 bit?)
* Browser type & Version (if web app), any browser add-ons which may be involved (e.g. AdBlocker, NoScript, etc.)
* Desktop Environment (if desktop app) / Version    
* Rocket.Chat edition / Version or [build number] (/3.%20Support%2Frelease_version_info.md)
* Expected behavior vs. Actual behavior (In other words, the "bug")
* Can it be reproduced? If yes, how?
* Relevant snippets from your error logs
* Screen shots if helpful to communicate the problem

## Rocket.Chat At-A-Glance
* [issues](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues) categorize bug reports. 
* [labels](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels) organize what we're doing.
