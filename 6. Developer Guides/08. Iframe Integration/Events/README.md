# Iframe Events

## Events sent

Here is a list of events triggered from Rocket.Chat when the iframe integration is enabled:

Event name | Description
----------- | -----------
`notification` | Fired when a user receives a notification
`unread-changed-by-subscription` | Fired each time a user's subscription record changes (i.e.: unread counts, etc)
`unread-changed` | Fired when the pages title changes
`room-opened` | Fired when a room is opened
`new-message` | Fired everytime the opened room receives a new message
`click-user-card-message` | Fired when the user clicks on a username link
`click-mention-link` | Fired when the user clicks on a mention link
`click-message-link` | Fired when the user clicks on a posted link
`click-action-link` | Fired when the user clicks on an action link button (i.e.: "click to join" to video conferences)

Above there is a sample code that listens to events fired from Rocket.Chat opened on an `iframe`:

```
window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
    console.log(e.data.eventName); // event name
    console.log(e.data.data); // event data
});
```
