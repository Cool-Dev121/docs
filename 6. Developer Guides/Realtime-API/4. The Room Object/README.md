# The Room Object

The room object represents any form of communication between two or more users. There are at least two fields on the room object.

- `_id`: The room / user id (depends on the room type)
- `t`: The room type

## Room Types

- `d`: Direct chat
- `c`: Chat
- `p`: Private chat
- `l`: Livechat

The information that comes with the room object changes according to its type.

### Direct chat

A direct chat between two users. In this case the room object only has two fields:

- `_id`: The room id
- `t`: The room type (in this case `d`)

Example:

```json
{
    "_id": "room-id",
    "t": "d"
}
```

You'll need to access the room information using data from [Get Subscriptions](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/realtime-api/method-calls/get-subscriptions).

### Chat

An open chat room. An chat contains more information about the room as it follows:

- `_id`: The room id
- `t`: The room type (in this case `c`)
- `name`: The room name
- `u`: The room creator (it may return a null user)
- `topic`: (Optional) The room topic
- `muted`: (Optional) A collection of muted users by its username
- `jitsiTimeout`: (Optional) (?)

Example:

```json
{
    "_id": "room-id",
    "t": "c",
    "name": "room-name",
    "u": { "_id": "user-id", "username": "username" },
    "topic": "room-topic",
    "muted": [ "username" ],
    "jitsiTimeout": { "$date": 1480377601 }
}
```

### Private chat

A private chat room. This type of room resembles the open chat room with an addition.

- `_id`: The room id
- `t`: The room type (in this case `p`)
- `name`: The room name
- `u`: The room creator (it may return a null user)
- `topic`: (Optional) The room topic
- `muted`: (Optional) A collection of muted users by its username
- `jitsiTimeout`: (Optional) (?)
- `ro`: Flags if the room is read-only

Example:

```json
{
    "_id": "room-id",
    "t": "p",
    "name": "room-name",
    "u": { "_id": null, "username": null },
    "topic": "room-topic",
    "ro": false // This room is not read-only
}
```
