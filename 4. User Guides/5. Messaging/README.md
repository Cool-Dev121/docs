# Messaging

## Composing messages

Sending messages in Rocket.Chat is self-explanatory: type a message in the message box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the Send Button.

If you want to send multiple lines of text, press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to add a new line.

## Cursor movement while composing a message

You can move the cursor using the arrow keys while writing or editing messages. When you press the `Up Arrow` or `Down Arrow` keys, the cursor moves to the location determined by the wrapping of the text.

### Move the cursor to the beginning or end of a message

Holding `Alt` or `Command` while pressing an arrow key moves to the beginning or end of the message.

## Notify other team members

To get someone’s attention in a channel, type `@` followed by their username, for example `@guarilha`. (They’ll see a red badge on the channel and be notified via email or their mobile device if they’re not online)

You can also notify everyone in a channel by typing `@all`. But avoid using `@all` because it notifies everyone. Although `@all` is useful for important announcements, it can be distracting if abused.

## Sending attachments

In Rocket.Chat you can send a variety of attachments on your message, like files, audio, links, videos, and many more.

To access the attachment menu you can simply click on the plus (+) icon on the message input.

### Files

You can select files using three methods:

- By selecting the `Select Files from Computer` option from the attachment menu;
- By dragging and dropping the file on Rocket.Chat;
- By pasting a image from the clipboard;

After Selecting the file, you will be prompted to add a name and a description to it. After that just press send.

_Be aware that the server administrator can block certain file types from being uploaded._
