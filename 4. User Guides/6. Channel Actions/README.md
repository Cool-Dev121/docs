# Channel Actions

With channels you can also do more than simply post messages and upload files, you can interact with it in various ways trough the channel actions menu, the channel actions are located by the right of the channel title. To access some of the menus you might have to click on the three dots by the end of the channel header.

_Channel actions may vary depending on the server configuration, so you might not see all of the items listed below_

## Favorites

To help you organize and prioritize your communications, you can **favorite** (or **star**) channels, private groups, and DMs.

To favorite a channel, click on the star icon in left end of the channel header (next to the room name).

Favoriting a channel moves it to a "Favorites" section on the channels list, thus making easier to access and find.

## Channel Info

Here you can see all kinds of information about the channel you are currently on, and if you have the proper permissions, edit this information. You have the following options on channel info:

- __Channel Name__: This is name of the channel, is how users see the title and find the channel via search.

- __Topic__: The topic will show next to the title on the channel header. Great for giving more info on what is the channel about.

- __Announcement__: The announcement will be shown in a very visible bar under the channel header.

- __Description__: The description of the channel.

- __Private__: Tells if a channel is private or not, can be used to change the channel to private or public.

- __Read Only__: Tells if a channel is read only, can be used to toggle the read only status on the channel. In read only channels messages can only be posted by people with the right permission, great for announcements channels and alike.

- __Archived__: Tells if a channel is archived, can be used to toggle the archived status on a channel. In a archived channel nobody can post messages and the channel search won't find that channel.

## Search Messages

Rocket Chat search supports basic search commands which work similar to Gmail search.

Rocket Chat also supports the use of "[regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)", the benefits of which are great search flexibility and the ability to search chat entries in any language, even ones which are traditionally a challenge for search (e.g. "CJK" languages - Chinese, Japanese, Korean).

### Basic Search Commands

You can use the following commands before or after entering your search term:

`from:me` to search for messages only created by the current user.

`from:user.name` to search for messages created by a specific user. The username entered must be the format without spaces (i.e. "john.doe" and not "John Doe". If you want to search for anytime a user was mentioned, simply search for their username.

`has:star` returns messages that are starred by the current user.

`is:pinned` or `has:pin` returns messages that are pinned in the current channel.

`has:url` or `has:link` returns messages that contain a link.

`has:location` or `has:map` returns messages that have a location attached

`before:dd/mm/yyyy`, `after:dd/mm/yyyy` and `on:dd/mm/yyyy` return message that were created before, after or on the provided date.
You can also use dashes `dd-mm-yyyy` or dots `dd.mm.yyyy` instead of slashes.

`order:asc` sorts messages by ascending timestamp. You can also use `order:ascend` or `order:ascending`

`order:desc` sorts messages by ascending timestamp. You can also use `order:descend` or `order:descending`.

You can also jump to where a message is located by hovering your mouse over the search result and selecting `jump to message`.
