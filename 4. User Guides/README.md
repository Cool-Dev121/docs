# User Guides

Here you'll find guides on how to use Rocket.Chat as a user.

## Channels

Conversations in Rocket.Chat can be organized into __Channels__: public chat rooms which anyone on your team can join. Channels are for conversations that are open to your entire team.

This means it's easy to find what's going on with your team, even for new Users who can join the Channel and read all the information that was previously shared by other Users.

When in doubt, create a Channel. Public conversations help you build a knowledge base of your organization with minimal effort. You might want to create a channel based on a company department or a programming language discussion, for example.

## Private Rooms

Private groups are closed Channels, meaning it's best used for subjects that are sensitive or confidential, or limited to a small group of team members.

Private groups can be joined by invitation only. You can decide who can invite others to a private group by setting up permissions. By default, only administrators, room owners and moderators can invite others to private rooms.

## Direct Messages

Direct messages (DMs) are useful for private, 1-on-1 conversation between team members. These conversations are visible only to you and the person you DM with.

## Favorites

To help you organize and prioritize things, we recommend you add your favorite Channels, DMs and Private Groups using the star icon in the upper left hand corner of the message area, right next to the room name.

This is really useful to avoid noise and focus on what's important to you.

## Messaging

Sending messages in Rocket.Chat is pretty self-explanatory. There's the message box, you type in the message and press Enter or the Send Button.

If you want to send multiple lines of text, press shift + enter to move to the next line.

### Notify other team members

To get someone’s attention in a channel, type @ followed by their username, e.g. @guarilha. (They’ll see a red badge on the Channel and be notified via email or their mobile device if they’re not online)

You can also notify everyone in a channel by typing @all, but please avoid using this! While it’s useful for important announcements, it can quickly be distracting if abused.

### Deleting Messages

The ability to delete message is configurable under Rocket.Chat Administration panel.

When enabled, you can delete a message by clicking the cog icon in your message and then clicking the trash icon in the menu popover. A confirmation will be displayed before the message is deleted.

It's also possible to hide or show "Message removed" when messages are deleted.
