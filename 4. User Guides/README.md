# User Guides

Here you'll learn how to use [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) as a user.

## Accessing a server

To access a server you will need to [connect](connect-to-server/) to it, [register](registration/) an account and [login](login/).

## Managing your account

Once logged into a Rocket.Chat server you can [manage your account](manage-your-account/) and configure profile, avatar, security, localization and notification settings.

## Channel operations

### Favorites

To help you organize and prioritize your communications, we recommend you **favorite** (or **star**) channels, private groups, and DMs.

To favorite a channel, click on the star icon in the upper left hand corner of the message area (next to the room name):

<img src="unstarred-channel.png" alt="Example of a starred channel" width="150"/>

Then the star becomes yellow:

<img src="starred-channel.png" alt="Example of a starred channel" width="143"/>

and that channel appears under the list of **Favorites** in the left-hand pane:

<img src="favorites-list.png" alt="Example of a starred channel" width="150"/>

Starring helps you to avoid noise and to focus on what's important to you.

## Messaging

Sending messages in Rocket.Chat is self-explanatory: type a message in the message box and press &#x23ce; (Enter) or the Send Button (<img src="send-icon.png" alt="Send icon" align="top" height="20"/>).

If you want to send multiple lines of text, press &#x21E7; &#x23ce; (shift + enter) to move to the next line.

### Notify other team members

To get someone’s attention in a channel, type `@` followed by their username, for example `@guarilha`. (They’ll see a red badge on the channel and be notified via email or their mobile device if they’re not online)

You can also notify everyone in a channel by typing `@all`. But avoid using `@all` because it notifies everyone. Although `@all` is useful for important announcements, it can be distracting if abused.

### Deleting Messages

The ability to delete message is configurable under Rocket.Chat Administration panel.

When enabled, you can delete a message by clicking the gear icon (<img src="gear-icon.png" alt="gear icon" align="top" width="20"/>) in your message and then clicking the trash icon in the menu popover. A confirmation will be displayed before the message is deleted.

It's also possible to hide or show "Message removed" when messages are deleted.

## Rocket.Chat ❤ Emoji!

To insert emoji in a message, hit the emoji button to the right of the text input to view an emoji picker. You can also type your desired emoji by wrapping its name with `:`; for example, `:heart:` produces :heart:.

### Emoji reactions

You can also _react_ to a message with an emoji.
+ On the **desktop** application: hover over a message, click on the gear icon (<img src="gear-icon.png" align="top" alt="gear icon" width="20"/>), click on the smiling face icon

<img src="emoji-reaction.png" align="top" alt="How to choose an emoji reaction" height="50"/>

and choose an emoji.
+ On the **mobile** application: press and hold your finger on a message to bring up a menu, press `Reactions`, and choose an emoji.

Then an emoji appears below the message:

<img src="emoji-reaction-result.png" align="top" alt="Example of an emoji reaction" height="75"/>

To remove an emoji reaction, click on the emoji below the message. To reiterate an existing emoji reaction that someone else posted, click on that emoji to add to that emoji's counter.
