# User Guides

Here you'll learn how to use [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) as a user.

## Channels

Conversations in Rocket.Chat are organized into __channels__. Channels are essentially chat rooms with many useful features. 

There are three kinds of channels: [public channels](Public-channels), [private groups](Private-groups), and [direct (1-on-1) messages](Direct-messages).


### Public channels

The most important kind of channel is a **public channel** (also called **channel** for short). Use channels for conversations that are open to your entire team. A channel can be joined by anyone on your team. 

Channels make it easy to find what's going on with your team. New team members can join a channel and read all the information that was previously shared by other users.

When in doubt, create a channel. Public conversations help you build a knowledge base of your organization with minimal effort. For example, create a channel for a company department or to discuss a certain programming language.

### Private groups

Private groups are closed channels, meaning they are best used for subjects that are sensitive, confidential, or limited to a small group of team members.

Private groups can be joined by invitation only. You can decide who can invite others to a private group by changing the permissions. By default, only administrators, room owners, and moderators can invite others to private rooms.

### Direct Messages

Direct messages (DMs) are useful for private, 1-on-1 conversation between team members. These conversations are visible only to you and the person you DM with.

## *Favorite* channels, private groups, and direct messages

To help you organize and prioritize things, we recommend you add your favorite Channels, DMs and Private Groups using the star icon in the upper left hand corner of the message area, right next to the room name. Starring helps you to avoid noise and to focus on what's important to you.

## Messaging

Sending messages in Rocket.Chat is self-explanatory: type a message in the message box and press Enter or the Send Button.

If you want to send multiple lines of text, press `shift + enter` to move to the next line.

### Notify other team members

To get someone’s attention in a channel, type @ followed by their username, e.g. @guarilha. (They’ll see a red badge on the Channel and be notified via email or their mobile device if they’re not online)

You can also notify everyone in a channel by typing @all, but please avoid using this! While it’s useful for important announcements, it can quickly be distracting if abused.

### Deleting Messages

The ability to delete message is configurable under Rocket.Chat Administration panel.

When enabled, you can delete a message by clicking the cog icon in your message and then clicking the trash icon in the menu popover. A confirmation will be displayed before the message is deleted.

It's also possible to hide or show "Message removed" when messages are deleted.

## Setting up Notifications
- Setup [desktop and push notifications](Notifications)

## Rocket.Chat ❤ Emoji!

Just hit the emoji button at the right of the text input to view a list of quick emoji codes. You can also type your desired emoji by preceding it by `:`, like `:heart:` for example.

### Emoji reactions

You can also _react_ to a message with an emoji. On the desktop application, hover over a message, click on the gear icon, and click on the smiling face icon. Then choose your emoji. Then an emoji appears below the message. To remove an emoji reaction, click on the emoji below the message. To reiterate an existing emoji reaction that someone else posted, click on the message.
