# User Guides

Here you'll learn how to use [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) as a user.

## Accessing a server

To access a server you will need to [connect](connect-to-server/) to it, [register](registration/) an account and [login](login/).

## Managing your account

Once logged into a Rocket.Chat server you can [manage your account](manage-your-account/) and configure profile, avatar, security, localization and notification settings.

## Channels

Conversations in Rocket.Chat are organized into __channels__. Channels are chat rooms with many useful features.

There are three kinds of channels: [public channels](#public-channels), [private groups](#private-groups), and [direct (1-on-1) messages](#direct-messages).

### Public channels

**Public channels** (also called **channels** for short) are the most important kind. Use channels for conversations that are open to your entire team. A channel can be joined by anyone on your team.

Channels make it easy to find what's going on with your team. New team members can join a channel and read all the information previously shared by other users.

When in doubt, create a channel. Public conversations help you build a knowledge base of your organization with minimal effort. For example, create a channel for a company department or to discuss a certain programming language.

### Private groups

**Private groups** are closed channels. They are visible only to their members. Use private groups for subjects that are sensitive, confidential, or limited to a small group of team members.

Private groups can be joined by invitation only. The administrator sets the permissions that determine who can invite others to a private group. By default, only administrators, room owners, and moderators can invite others to private rooms.

### Direct Messages

**Direct messages (DMs)** are private, 1-on-1 conversation between team members. You can think of a DM as a private group with only two members.

## Channel operations

### Favorites

To help you organize and prioritize your communications, we recommend you **favorite** (or **star**) channels, private groups, and DMs.

To favorite a channel, click on the star icon in the upper left hand corner of the message area (next to the room name):

Then the star becomes yellow:

<img src="starred-channel.png" alt="Example of a starred channel" width="143"/>

and that channel appears under the list of **Favorites** in the left-hand pane:

<img src="favorites-list.png" alt="Example of a starred channel" width="150"/>

Starring helps you to avoid noise and to focus on what's important to you.

### Joining channels

Find existing channels by clicking on the <img src="More channels.png" alt="More channels..." align="top" height="20"/> button on the left-hand pane. Then click on a channel to preview its contents. If you want to join it, click on the <img src="JOIN.png" alt="JOIN" align="top" height="20"/> button.

### Hiding and leaving channels

There are two notions of leaving a channel:

1. To **hide** a channel is to remain a member of the channel but to remove it from your list of channels on the left-hand pane.
1. To **leave** a channel is to remove it from your list of channels _and to leave the channel_ (i.e., no longer be a member of the channel).

Every channel has an **owner**, and the owner of a channel cannot leave a channel until setting someone else as the owner of that channel. You can do it via right side panel (Flex tab) and "Member list".

To **leave** a channel, enter the command `/part` or `/leave` in the message window. Alternatively, hover your mouse over the channel in the list of channels on the left-hand side and click on the <img src="leave-icon.png" alt="right-pointing arrow"  align="top" height="20"/> button. On the mobile app, pull from the left-hand side to see the list of open channels, hold down on the channel to bring up the buttons, and click on the <img src="leave-icon.png" alt="right-pointing arrow" align="top" height="20"/> button.

To **hide** a channel, hover your mouse over the channel in the list of channels on the left-hand side and click on the <img src="hide-icon.png" alt="eyeball" align="top" height="20"/> button. On the mobile app, pull from the left-hand side to see the list of open channels, hold down on the channel to bring up the buttons, and click on the <img src="hide-icon.png" alt="eyeball" align="top" height="20"/> button.
