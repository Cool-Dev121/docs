# Pinning Messages

Pin the most important messages of the channel for __everybody__ to see.

Note that this is only enabled for admins, owners and moderators by default and needs to be allowed for normal users in the preferences under message settings.

## What exactly does pinning a message do?
Pinning a message to a channel causes the message to be easily accessible via the right icon menu. This allows for important information to be pinned to a channel, so people can easily see important information.
