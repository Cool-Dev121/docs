# The Home screen

The first time you connect and login to a server you will be show the Rocket.Chat home screen.

The home screen shows first time users how to access channels and direct messages from the left sidebar and how to join the Rocket.Chat community on GitHub and social networks.

The Home Screen won't be shown anymore once you navigate away from it.

If you would like to customize your server's first time user experience, think about adding guides and tutorials to the Home Screen.
