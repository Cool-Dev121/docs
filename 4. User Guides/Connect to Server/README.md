## Through a web browser  

To connect to a Rocket.Chat server through a web browser you need to enter its address in the browser's address bar.

If it is a valid Rocket.Chat server address you will then be presented with the [registration](../registration/]) and [login](../login/) page if unauthenticated or taken to the server's homepage if authenticated.

## Through a Rocket.Chat client application

To connect to a Rocket.Chat server using a client application you first need to download one of the [many client applications](https://rocket.chat/download).

If this is your first server you are connecting to with the client app you will be presented with the server connect screen. Enter the server address to connect to.

If it is a valid Rocket.Chat server address you will then be presented with the [registration](../registration/) and [login](../login/) page.
