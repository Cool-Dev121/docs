# Starring Messages

Star your favorite messages for __yourself__.

## What exactly does starring a message do?
Starring a message is similar to pinning a message, however starred messages are personal and only __you__ can see the messages you have starred. Starred messages are per chat room and are not global, each room has its own list of messages you have starred in that channel.
