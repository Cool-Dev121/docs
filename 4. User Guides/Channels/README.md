## Listing channels

The public and private channels you are watching are listed in the left sidebar under the "Channels" sections.

Public channels are indicated by a hash symbol next to the channel name, and private channels by a lock. Public channels appear first, private channels below them and each group will be ordered alphabetically.

To browse more channels to add to your watch list, click the "More channels..." link at the bottom of your channel list, this will open an advance search window to search for channels by name and filter searches by:

- Your membership status: **Joined** or **All**
- Channel discoverability: **Public**, **Private** or **All**

Search results can be sorted:

- Alphabetically by channel name
- By the number of messages in the channel, in descending order

Once you have found the channel you would like to preview, click the channel name in the search result list to preview it. While in preview mode can view messages, user profiles and access all the functionality in the channel sidebar. You won't be able to send, edit or react to message in preview mode.
