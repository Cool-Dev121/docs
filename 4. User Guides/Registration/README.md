# Registering an account

To be able to access a server you will need to first register an account manually or by using one of the many supported OAuth services and then [login](../login/).

## Manual registration

You can create an account by providing your:

- Name
- email
- Password and password confirmation

## OAuth registration

We support account registration and login with the following OAuth services:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Google
- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- Meteor

You can add additional OAuth providers to your self hosted Rocket.Chat server with plugins.

## Choosing a username

Once you have successfully registered you will be asked to choose your username. Your username is separate to your display name on the server. Your username is your unique identifier for others to use to direct message or mention you.

### Usernames and display names

Usernames on each Rocket.Chat server need to be unique but display names do not have to be unique. For example there can be only one user with the username `johnsmith` but there can be more than one user with the display name `John Smith`.
