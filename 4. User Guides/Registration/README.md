# Registering an account

To be able to access a server you will need to first register an account manually or by using one of the many supported OAuth services and then [login](../login/).

## Manual registration

You can create an account by providing your:

- Name
- email
- Password and password confirmation

## OAuth registration

We support account registration and login with the following OAuth services:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Google
- Facebook
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- Meteor

You can add additional OAuth providers to your self hosted Rocket.Chat server with plugins.

### Choosing a username

Once you have successfully registered you will be asked to choose your a username.

Usernames on each Rocket.Chat server need to be unique.
