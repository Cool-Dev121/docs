OTR - encrypted conversations
For enabling go to Administration -> OTR

You can use OTR only in direct chat (1-on-1) and also both sides must be online.  
When you wanna start OTR conversation, click on the _key_ symbol on the right side and then _START OTR_.  
After your request is confirmed by other side, your messages are encrypted.
