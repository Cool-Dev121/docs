## Building

In order to build Rocket.Chat for Android, you must have docker installed on your Linux (or OS/X) system.

You must have at least 4GB of RAM (16 GB recommended) and 10 GB of disk space available.

Then:

```shell
    $ docker pull rocketchat/meteor12androidbuilder
```

Follow the instructions [of the docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocketchat/meteor12androidbuilder/).
