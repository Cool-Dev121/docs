This is a work in progress deployment of the Meteor Guide. We're tracking our progress writing articles using [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/meteor/guide?label=article).

- See the example app we're working on to embody the principles from the guide at [meteor/todos](https://github.com/meteor/todos). Keep in mind that it's still a work in progress so some things are rough around the edges.
- Check out the [outlines and discussions](https://github.com/meteor/guide/labels/article)
