# Contributing

First of all, thanks! It's really awesome that you're interested in contributing to Rocket Chat.

##Getting Started 
If this is the first Open Source project you will contribute to, it'd be cool if you read GitHub's excellent guide ["Contributing to Open Source"](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).  
  
You can find Rocket.Chat repositories [here] (https://github.com/RocketChat). If you see some issue you are willing to work on, just comment on it. We will add a [In Progress label](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/stat%3A%20in%20progress), and that's it! Want a simple task to get you started? [We maintain a list of those](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/contrib%3A%20easy)!

**You don't have to write code to contribute!**  
We are always looking for help with creating or updating documentation, testing our apps (web, desktop and mobile) and reporting bugs. 

**Submitting Pull Requests**  
For contributions to code or documentation, you can fork the material, apply your contribution, and submit a [Pull Request] (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

**Submitting Bug Reports**  
Open an [Issue] (https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues) in the applicable repository.  
Try to include some basics which will help us troubleshoot the problem:

* Operating System / Version / Architecture (64 bit?)
* Browser type / Version (for web app), any browser add-ons which may be involved (for example: AdBlocker, NoScript, etc.)
* Desktop Environment (for desktop app) / Version    
* Rocket.Chat edition / Version or build number
* Expected behavior vs. Actual behavior (In other words, the "bug")
* Can it be replicated? If yes, how?
* Relevant snippets from your error logs
* Screen shots if helpful to communicate the problem

##Rocket.Chat At-A-Glance
* [issues](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues) categorize bug reports.
