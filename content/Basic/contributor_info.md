First of all, thanks! It's really awesome that you're interested in contributing to Rocket Chat. :)

If this is the first Open Source project you will contribute to, it'd be cool if you read GitHub's excellent guide ["Contributing to Open Source"](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

### The obvious way is to contribute with Pull Requests

We use github [issues](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues) to control bug reports. We tend to keep it simple, using [labels](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels) to organize what we're doing and [milestones](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/milestones) to control priority.

> Want a simple task to get you started? [We maintain a list of those](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/contrib%3A%20easy)!

If you see some issue you are willing to work on, just comment on it. We will add a [In Progress label](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/stat%3A%20in%20progress), and that's it!

### But you don't necessarily have to write code to contribute

We are always looking for help with creating or updating documentation (including this wiki), testing our apps (web, desktop and mobile) and reporting bugs. 

You can also place a bounty on an issue you care about: https://www.bountysource.com/teams/rocketchat
