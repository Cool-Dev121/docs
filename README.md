# Meteor Guide

[![Articles complete](https://badge.waffle.io/meteor/guide.svg?label=ready&title=Articles%20Complete)](https://waffle.io/meteor/guide?label=article)

We're tracking our progress using Waffle.io; see the board by clicking the badge above!

- See the example app we're working to embody the principles from the guide at [meteor/todos](https://github.com/meteor/todos)
- Check out the [outlines we've written](https://github.com/meteor/guide/tree/master/outlines)

Current goals:

1. Get feedback internally at MDG about the article outlines and polish them up
2. Pump out some rough drafts of articles as fast as we can
3. Get the guide website up and running

---------

We're building a Meteor Guide. Like the [Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/), but for Meteor. We're going to do this totally out in the open, and we can't do it without the community.
