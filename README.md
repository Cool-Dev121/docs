We're building a Meteor Guide. Like the [Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/), but for Meteor. We're going to do this totally out in the open, and we can't do it without the community.

### Action items for community

1. Read the charter below and the [proposed outlines for guide articles](outlines.md)
2. Ask questions on the [forum thread](https://forums.meteor.com/t/new-mdg-project-the-meteor-guide/10873)
2. Submit pull requests on the outlines to add things that are missing
3. File issues here for discussion

### Action items for MDG

1. Consider and respond to all community feedback
2. Set up GitHub pages site with basic theme and structure
2. Set up hooks to deploy PRs and branches
